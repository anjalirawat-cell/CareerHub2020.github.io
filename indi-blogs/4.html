                        <h3>Is it important to have a goal?</h3>
                        <h3>-Nishtha Chib</h3>
                        <p>Ever since I remember being a student, I have been asked about what my goal is (“Kya banna chahte ho”)? But I never had a fixed answer to it; it always depended on the situation and my knowledge about things. Even when I decided to take science in the 11th standard it was because I scored good marks last year. I also always heard that one can go to any field if s/he takes science.</p><br/>
                        <p>I always wondered how important it is to have a goal or know what I want to do with my life or do I even want to do something? What my interests are? And most importantly, what is affecting my decision every time I come up with something new? It was very difficult since I didn’t have anyone who could guide me through this journey.</p><br/>
                        <p>So recently I decided on doing something that has been helping me a lot, to improve my work and get better with each passing day. Since I don’t know what my ultimate goal is, I’ve been setting small goals and then I look forward to how I can reach them. It can be a daily, weekly, or even monthly goal. Once I complete something I decided to, it makes me willing to do more. Doing this has been one of the best things I have done to improve my work and even my lifestyle.</p><br/>
                        <p>I’ve met and seen a lot of people who know what they want to do but once they starting working in a professional environment, they find other things more interesting and after a point in their life, they change their fields completely and work towards their interested fields.</p><br/>
                        <p>Since we don’t know and are not able to learn about all the perspectives and skills used in a professional atmosphere at the initial stages of our lives, it is not possible for everyone to decide what they ultimately want to do in their life. It is definitely better to have simple and short term goals that you can complete so that you can inspect how you’re doing, and also change your line if you don’t like it. These are the small steps that are eventually going to lead you to something that you want to do and make you capable enough to work better in any field.</p><br/>
                        <p>Having goals gives us something to look forward to when we wake up each morning. Setting goals and then working hard to achieve them sets you on the path of a purpose-driven life. There is no such thing as being too old to change your life and set new goals and dreams for yourself.</p><br/>
                        <p>When I was writing this, a saying popped in my mind, that if you’re aiming high, set your goals properly. That is the only way you can achieve huge things. But when you don’t know and can’t decide, it is always better to have small goals and aim a little lower than people around you. And when you finally know it, then the sky definitely doesn’t have a limit.</p><br/>
                        <p>"Never quit. It is the easiest cop-out in the world. Set a goal and don’t quit until you attain it. When you do attain it, set another goal, and don’t quit until you reach it. Never quit." –Bear Bryant</p>
