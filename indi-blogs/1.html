                        <h3>College Life Bollywood v/s Reality</h3>
                        <h3> -Shreya Gupta</h3>
                        <p>College life in Bollywood might be like Poo and Shanaya’s, but the reality is way different. I too had a dream about how my college life was going to be, while in school, but it got shattered the first time I entered my college. I come from a non-campus DU girls-college, and I can tell you that we don’t see lines/groups of boys in front of our college. *Busting a myth there*</p><br/>
                        <p>We don’t have proms or disco nights, instead, boys are not even allowed in our college premises on fests until they participate in any competitions. If you fancy college life after watching Karan Johar’s stupid movies, I warn you about the shock your real college is going to give you. Just like when you’re listening to a great song and Badshah’s rap comes in.</p><br/>
                        <p>If we talk about getting dressed up, Delhi’s traveling modes don’t give you much freedom until you’re very confident. I’ve seen girls come in pajamas to college and I’ve also seen girls in hot pants and crop tops. So it’s totally up to your comfort and motivation. Surprisingly, some colleges make you wear a uniform, so your Shanaya inspired wardrobe? In the drain.</p><br/>
                        <p>Bollywood movies like 2 States and Student of the Year will lead you to think that we get to celebrate various occasions in college. It’s all a lie. Ta-da! We study in an education system where attendance matters more than knowledge. If you get into an average college, celebrations is a far off thing, you won’t even have the motivation to come to your own college fresher’s or fest.</p><br/>
                        <p>Teachers in colleges are very different from that in schools. In schools, they do care about you but in college? They just don’t give a damn about you. They’ll open a Powerpoint Presentation and read it out for you and then expect you to give exams. (Not talking about top colleges, of course. They use presentations, and then explain to you what’s typed in the presentation :) Also, teachers like Ms. Braganza and principals like Mr. Malhotra aren’t real guys, trust me.</p><br/>
                        <p>If you really want to watch Bollywood movies that show reality, go watch 3 Idiots. Yes, suicides are real, the hard work students have to do on their own is real, and friendships like those are real too. After 2 years of college, I can clearly see these stupid and great friends I made at college, in my future. School gives you friendships, many times they last too, but college will give you friendships that will surely last. Now, talking about relationships, being in an all-girls college kind of made it difficult for me… but I can assure you, there are extremely rare cases of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai or Yaariyan in real life.</p><br/>
                        <p>Talking about Yaariyan, college trips aren’t that easy, my friend. Half of your parents won’t allow you for it. If you experience a trip to Goa with your friends, it means your college life just got successful. Even a road trip can be counted as a success. But here, we are planning our trip since the first year and now we’re finding the vaccine for Corona. Strolls to the Maggi and momo stalls are our support and successful trips.</p>
