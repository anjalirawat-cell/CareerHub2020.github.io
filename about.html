                <h3 class="text-center">Story Behind It</h3>
                <p>As a group project, our team was put under a task to create anything we want, in the field we want to excel.
                We all came to a conclusion to create a dynamic website. Now, our question was, about what? Running through options, we started
                thinking about what situations we've faced in our lives, when we got fed up and wondered if we had a website for that problem to make
                our lives simpler.</p>
                <p>Here is a combination of all the educational websites which provide you with information about various courses and colleges
                in India which a student can persue after his/her schooling. No more visiting a number of websites and not get satisfied.
                CareerHub is a complete solution!</p>
                <p>CareerHub also has a personalized counselor where you can simply answer a few questions and get information where and how to apply
                for your higher studies. Isn't that impressive?</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Mission</h3>
                <p>Our mission is to help out students who want to know their options for higher studies, with exact, to the point details.</p>

                <p>I was always excited about the computer classes and labs in the school. Later, I chose computers as one of my subjects in school and since I was into programming, I picked web designing as my course in college. Learning a new language is always challenging and with a computer language, your mind starts thinking logically, which is the best part. I love working on gaining more knowledge and improving my skills.</p>

                <p>I got really amazed when I first used HTML and saw the changes reflect on the browser window, it felt like magic. Since then I’ve been keen on learning various aspects of web development. I love working on the front end, but my passion is dancing. I love to juggle between academics and extracurricular, it’s fun.</p>

                <p>When I was a kid I was always fascinated by computers around me and wanted to do anything I could. My first proper interaction with computers was when I was in 3rd, through a small course in Bal Bhawan. The first computer language I learned was HTML. My focus presently is on exploring as much as I can, to work with different languages and applications, and do well in the field.</p>

                <p>I am a graphic designer with interests in sketching and music. My stream in 12th standard was Science with Computers. Being a self taught graphic designer, I am always exploring new things about my passion. Graphics attracted me because I love to draw and use my creative mind.</p>

                <p> I did my class 12th with biology and maths. So when I picked this field, it was entirely new for me but it also looked very appealing, therefore I started learning it from scratch. I love listening to music, and sometimes, I like to draw. I am really looking forward in this field.</p>

                <p>If we take rough estimations, around 60% students find it difficult to finalize their careers and come across various decision making
                problems while choosing a field. Studying Indian culture and mindsets, many parents still force their children into taking up
                courses they don't want.</p>
                <p>We can't directly affect that aspect, but help the student know about his/her options and give them information
                to ponder over, so that they can be sure of their interests and possibly stand up for themselves.</p>
                <p>If our initiative could help even 1 in a 100 students to get to the course / college of his/her choice, it would be great. At least
                they won't face the difficulties we faced while choosing our careers, and that would mean a lot :)</p>
